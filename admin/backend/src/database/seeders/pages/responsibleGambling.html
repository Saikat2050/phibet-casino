RESPONSIBLE GAMING

Playing at ARC Casino. should be fun and enjoyable. Our mission is to entertain you but we understand the
  potential risks of problem gaming. We have provided below some ways to make sure your gaming is within
  controllable limits along with suggesting some places to go to if you need help.

Here are some tips:

Jobs are for making money, but gaming is for entertainment. Treat it as an entertainment expense, like a ticket
      to the cinema, rather than a way to make money.

Only gamble with money you can afford to lose.

Know your limits and be clear about them before you start betting.

Take a break. Gaming continuously without taking a break will impact your judgement.

Don’t gamble when you’re upset or depressed. Talk to mates or family or get in touch with a Help
      Organization.

Do other stuff. Sometimes less is more, so make gaming a part of a well-balanced lifestyle.

Don’t go chasing losses. Set your limits, stay in control.

KNOW YOUR LIMITS
Since at ARC Casino we believe that your ability to play safely is very important, we have tools that are
  there for you to use if you feel the need to have a break.
In the Limits section of your account you will find:
Deposit Limits
This will limit the amount you can deposit during a certain period. Once you have reached this sum you will not be
  able to make any new deposits until your limit is reset.
Wager Limits
This will limit the total amount you can bet during a certain period. When you have reached these sums, you will not
  be able to place any new bets until your limit is reset.
Loss Limits
This limit will prevent you from losing more than you are willing to lose. (winnings are not included in the
  calculation). Once you reach the loss limit they will be unable to lose beyond the set limit.
Session Limits
It’s important that you keep track of the amount of time you spend gaming. We recommend you take note of the
  time you start gaming set Session Limits and keep an eye on the clock to make sure that you aren’t spending
  more time than you should be. We also strongly advise you to keep your device clock enabled whilst gaming so you can
  easily refer to it.
Take a Break
You may feel in control but would like a break to consider your gaming, or maybe you are in the middle of a busy
  time and don’t want to spend time or energy on gaming. If this is the case, taking a break may help you.
Take a Break can be applied to your account from 24 hours up to a maximum of 30 days During this period, you will be
  restricted from accessing your ARC Casino account and we will stop any contact or marketing offers.
Self-Exclusion
Should you be unable to control your gaming and decide to make a much longer break or even permanent, then it is
  possible to self-exclude. Choosing to self-exclude will mean that it will not be possible to reopen your account once
  in effect for periods ranging from six months to 1 year or even Permanent by clicking here. In order to request a longer self-exclusion please contact us
  via live chat or email gsgaming@phibet.com.

SELF ASSESSMENT TEST

  apply to you. The result will provide you with a breakdown of how gaming is affecting your life and will give you
  personalised recommendations for your next steps.

PROFESSIONAL SUPPORT
Gamblers Anonymous
is a fellowship of men and women who share their experience, strength and hope with each other that they may solve
  their common problem and help others to do the same. They offer various aids for the compulsive gambler including a
  forum, a chat room, literature and most importantly a meeting finder.
GamCare
Founded in 1997, GamCare is the leading provider of information, advice and support for anyone affected by problem
  gaming. They operate the National Gaming Helpline, provide treatment for problem gamblers and their families,
  create awareness about responsible gaming and treatment, and encourage an effective approach to responsible gaming
  within the gaming industry

ADDITIONAL TIPS
Many banks, fintech banks and e-wallet providers across Europe now offer gaming blocks that allow their customers
  to block gaming transactions on their accounts. If you want to implement these, your bank should explain how to do
  this, or could even do it for you. Please be aware that these blocks are not permanent, they can be switched on and
  off with varying delays, so it’s also a good idea to have other support in place if you want to stop gaming
  completely.
Some banks may also allow you to set a spending limit for a single debit card transaction, or temporarily freeze your
  card if you feel like your spending is getting out of control. This will vary from bank to bank so check what
  protections your bank can put in place for you.
Another way of taking some time away from online gaming is to put a “blocker” on your device,
  well-known ones are Gamblock or Betblocker.
